## 🛠️ Technologies Used

## 🚧 Current Status

While LTNG File Browser is functional, we must admit that its current appearance leaves much to be desired 😢😭. We're working hard to improve the user interface and make it as sleek and modern as the technology behind it! 🛠️💪

Despite its current looks, the core functionality is solid, and we're excited about the potential for improvement. Stay tuned for updates, and feel free to contribute if you have ideas for making it look amazing! 🌈✨
